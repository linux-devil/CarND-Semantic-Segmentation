## CarND-Semantic-Segmentation
SDCND - Semantic Segmentation based on FCNs 

## Overview

Semantic Segmentation is one of the high-level task that paves the way towards complete scene understanding. Objective of the project is to label the pixels of traffic data as road or non-road category. using the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) described in the Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation by Jonathan Long, Even Shelhamer, and Trevor Darrel.
