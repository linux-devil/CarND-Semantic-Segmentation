## CarND-Semantic-Segmentation
SDCND - Semantic Segmentation based on FCNs 

## Overview

Semantic Segmentation is one of the high-level task that paves the way towards complete scene understanding. Objective of the project is to label the pixels of traffic data as road or non-road category. using the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) described in the [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf) by Jonathan Long, Even Shelhamer, and Trevor Darrel. The project is based on the starting project provided by Udacity in this [repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Semantic-Segmentation).
