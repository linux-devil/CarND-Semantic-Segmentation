## CarND-Semantic-Segmentation
SDCND - Semantic Segmentation based on FCNs 

## Overview

Semantic Segmentation is one of the high-level task that paves the way towards complete scene understanding. Objective of the project is to label the pixels of traffic data as road or non-road category. using the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) described in the [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf) by Jonathan Long, Even Shelhamer, and Trevor Darrel. The project is based on the starting project provided by Udacity in this [repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Semantic-Segmentation).

### Setup

main.py will check to make sure you are using GPU - if you don't have a GPU on your system, you can use AWS or another cloud computing platform.

#### Frameworks and Packages
Make sure you have the following is installed:

Python 3
